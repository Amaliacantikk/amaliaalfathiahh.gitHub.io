                                <p> I joined the Persis association which is PERSIS-UniSZA Student Volunteer Organization and participated in the media unit.
                                    I am responsible for creating an application system for people who need help such as flood victims. Flood victims will provide information on the location of those who were flooded 
                                    and the PERSIS team will work together to help them. I use the neatbeans technology system with their html, css and javascript to create a precise website. 
                                    This makes it easier for those who need help. Project URL: PERSIS UniSZA. </P>

                                <p> The number one reason for Python’s popularity is its beginner-friendliness, which allows anyone, even individuals with no programming background, to pick up Python and start creating simple programs.
                                    But that’s not all. It also offers an exceptionally vast collection of packages and libraries that can play a key role in reducing the ETA for your projects, along with a strong community of like-minded developers that is eager to help.
                                     Although Python can be used to build pretty much anything, it really shines when it comes to working on technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analytics. 
                                     Python also proves to be useful for web development, creating enterprise applications, and GUIs for applications. Source: Python Official Website. Project URL:https://www.python.org. </P>

                                <p> R became one of the best programming languages for projects requiring extensive data analysis, graphical data modeling, spatial and time-series analysis.
                                R also provides great extensibility via its functions and extensions that offer a ton of specialized techniques and capabilities to developers. 
                                The language also works remarkably well with code from other programming languages, such as C, C++, Python, Java, and .NET.Project URL:https://www.r-project.org/about.html </P>
